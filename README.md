🛡️ Detecting Face Morphing Attacks for Secure Digital Transactions

This repository contains the implementation of my Final Year Project (FYP) titled:

“Detecting Face Morphing Attacks for Secure Digital Transactions”

The project focuses on improving the security of eKYC and digital identity verification systems by detecting face morphing attacks, where two identities are blended into a single facial image to bypass biometric authentication.

📌 Project Overview

Face morphing attacks pose a serious threat to biometric systems used in digital banking, online onboarding, and identity verification. Traditional face recognition systems often fail to detect whether an input image has been manipulated.

This project investigates both:

Single-image Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD)

Differential Morphing Attack Detection (D-MAD)

and proposes a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both approaches.
